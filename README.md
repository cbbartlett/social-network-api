In this module, I create an API for a social network. It uses Express.js for the routing, MongoDB for the datbase, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Installation

To install the API, you must first clone the repostiory:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/cbbartlett/social-network-api 
```

Afterwards, run following command in your terminal:

``` sh
npm install
```

Once all the Node packages are installed,  you will need to specify what database you wish to connect to. Also, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`, and fill in the neccesary connection information.

## Usage

Run `npm run seed` to create tables with example information. Once everything is connected, run `npm run start` to start up the backend.
